//if both synapses are inactive (no excitation or inhibition), selected_feedback will just equal original_feedback, maintaining the LFSRâ€™s usual behavior.
//if excitatory pulse is active, it will make the feedback more likely to be 1, pushing the LFSR to toggle its state more actively.
//if inhibitory signal is active, it will force the feedback to 0, which suppresses the feedback and dampens the LFSR's toggle.
